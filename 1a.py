#In
#The program accepts two positive integers, a and b, one on each line
#The first line contains the sum of a and b.

#Out
#The second line contains the value of b subtracted from a.
#The third line contains the product of a and b.
#The fourth line contains the quotient when a is divided by b. (excluding the remainder)
#The fifth line contains the remainder when a is divided by b.

a = int(input('Enter a:'))

print(a+b)
print(b-a)
print(a*b)
